UPDATE

i-doit update procedure:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0. You should always create a BACKUP of your data and system databases,
   you never know what could happen!

    - To create a database backup under unix systems, try:

    	mysqldump -uroot -p idoit_data > idoit_data.sql
    	mysqldump -uroot -p idoit_system > idoit_system.sql

      Where idoit_data is your client and idoit_system your system
      database. For Windows backups you can use mysqldump.exe in mysql's
      bin directory with same syntax.

    Note: If you've changed some constants in src/constants.inc.php or
    	  edited some of the other source files you have to backup and
    	  re-insert these changes after the update, because everything
    	  is gonna be overwritten.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Extract the update package into your i-doit directory. Normally this
   should create a new directory 'updates' and overwrite some of the
   existing files.

2. This step is for Unix users only:
   Because the automatic i-doit updater copies all relevant files over the
   existing ones, the Apache user needs write access to the complete i-doit
   directory. To accomplish this, you can use the script idoit-rights.sh in
   the i-doit directory. The script uses the Debian default user "www-data".
   If you are using another distribution you should edit the script and
   modify he user/group variables to you needs.

   If everything seems to be fine, do "./idoit-rights.sh set" to set the
   corresponding rights. "./idoit-rights.sh unset" to reset them after
   the update.

   Alternatively you can use "chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/idoit",
   of course.

3. Ok, now it's time to go to "http://<your i-doit URL>/updates" to browse
   to the updater.

4. Choose to which version you want to update. The bold one, should be your
   current one. All displayed versions below are the new ones.

5. After clicking you need to select the databases you want to update.

6. Finally you can choose whether you want to update your files or leave
   them untouched. We recommend that you also update your files.

7. After clicking next again, the update procedure should start. Debug logs
   are available in your temp directory after the update is done.
